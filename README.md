<h1>Ice Cream Eater<h1>

<h4>An app using node, express, and handlebars to eat the ice cream!</h4>

<p>"Ice Cream Eater" is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of ice cream they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits an ice cream flavor, the app will display the name on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten up. Each flavor in the waiting area also has an `Eat Up!` button. When the user clicks it, the ice cream will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every flavor in a database, whether eaten up or not. Here is a view of the homepage:</p>
